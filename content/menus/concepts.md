## Resource Paths
These are like the URLs in the browser you're using to read this, they're links
that tell the plugin what page to open and where it's located.

[For more reading: see the Resource Paths page](/menus/paths)

## Instance Names
When you open a Delphi page, it needs some way to be identified, this is where
Instance names come in. **Instance names are unique names given to every open 
page.**

Unless an instance name is explicitly set when opened, an automatic name will 
be given instead, automatic names follow the formula of `delphi-page-#`, where
the `#` is an incrementing number.
